[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/godaddy/node-cluster-service.png)](https://travis-ci.org/godaddy/node-cluster-service) [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/cluster-service.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/cluster-service) [![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/godaddy/node-cluster-service.png)](https://gemnasium.com/godaddy/node-cluster-service)


## Install

	npm install cluster-service

https://npmjs.org/package/cluster-service


## What is it?

The short answer:

	Turns your single process code into a fault-resilient multi-process service with
	built-in REST & CLI support.

The long answer:

	Adds the ability to execute worker processes over N cores for extra service resilience,
	includes worker process monitoring and restart on failure, continuous integration,
	as well as HTTP & command-line interfaces for health checks, cluster commands,
	and custom service commands.


 
## Getting Started

Turning your single process node app/service into a fault-resilient multi-process service with all of the bells and whistles has never been easier!

Your existing application, be it console app or service of some kind:

	// server.js
	console.log("Hello World");

Now, with a few extra lines of code, you can add considerably resilience and capabilities to your existing services:

	// server.js
	require("cluster-service").start("./worker", { accessKey: "lksjdf982734" });

	// worker.js
	console.log("Hello World"); // notice we moved our original app logic to the worker
	require("cluster-service").workerReady(); // this new line is required

	

## Start Options

When initializing your service, there are a number of options that expose various features:

	require("cluster-service").start(workerPath, { accessKey: "123" });

* accessKey (*REQUIRED*) - A secret key that must be leveraged to invoke commands to your service. Allows CLI & REST interfaces.
* restartonFailure (default: true) - When a worker stops unexpectedly, should it be automatically restarted?
* host (default: "localhost") - Host to bind to for REST interface.
* port (default: 11987) - Port to bind to. If you leverage more than one cluster-service on a machine, you'll want to assign unique ports.
* workerCount (default: os.cpus().length) - Gives you control over the number of processes to run the same worker concurrently. Recommended to be 2 or more for fault resilience. But some workers do not impact availability, such as task queues, and can be run as a single instance.
* restartDelayMs (default: 100) - The delay between failure detection and restart.
* restartsPerMinute (default: 10) - How many restarts are permitted by a worker in a minute before determining too critical to recover from.
* allowHttpGet (default: false) - For development purposes, can be enabled for testing, but is not recommended otherwise.
* cliEnabled (default: true) - Enable the command line interface. Can be disabled for background services, or test cases.
 


## Console & REST API

A DPS Cluster Service has two interfaces, the console (stdio), and an HTTP REST API. The two interfaces are treated identical, as console input/output is piped over the REST API. The reason for the piping is that a DPS Cluster Service is intentionally designed to only support one version of the given service running at any one time, and the port binding is the resource constraint. This allows secondary services to act as console-only interfaces as they pipe all input/output over HTTP to the already running service that owns the port. This flow enables the CLI to background processes.
The REST API is locked to a "accessKey" expected in the query string. The console automatically passes this key to the REST API, but for external REST API access, the key will need to be known.

	{ host: "localhost", port: 11987, accessKey: "lksjdf982734" }


## Access Control

Commands may be granted "inproc" (no trust), "local" (low trust), or "remote" (default). Setting access control at compile time can be done within the command, like so:

```javascript
// exit.js
module.exports.control = function(){
	return "local";
};
```

Or may be overriden at runtime via:

```javascript
// server.js
require("cluster-service").control({ "exit": "local" });
```


## Continuous Integration

Combining the Worker Process (Cluster) model with a CLI piped REST API enables the ability command the already-running service to replace existing workers with workers in a different location. This capability is still a work in progress, but initial tests are promising.

* Cluster Service A1 starts
* N child worker processes started
* Cluster Service A2 starts
* A2 pipes CLI to A1
* A2 issues "upgrade" command
* A1 spins up A2 worker
* New worker is monitored for N seconds for failure, and cancels upgrade if failure occurs
* Remaining N workers are replaced, one by one, until all are running A2 workers
* Upgrade reports success
 

## Cluster Commands

While a Cluster Service may provide its own custom commands, below are provided out-of-the-box. Commands may be disabled by overriding them.

* start workerPath [cwd] [timeout:60] - Gracefully start service, one worker at a time.
* restart all|pid [timeout:60] - Gracefully restart service, waiting up to timeout before terminating workers.
* shutdown all|pid [timeout:60] - Gracefully shutdown service, waiting up to timeout before terminating workers.
* exit now - Forcefully exits the service.
* help [cmd] - Get help.
* test testScript [timeout:0] - (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED) A path to the test_script must be provided to perform tests against the code base within the given environment. If success (or failure) is not reported within the allotted timeout (in milliseconds, 0 for infinite), the test will be cancelled and considered a failure.
* upgrade all|pid workerPath [cwd] [timeout:60] - Gracefully upgrade service, one worker at a time. (for continuous integration support).
* workers - Returns list of active worker processes.
* health - Returns health of service. Can be overidden by service to expose app-specific data.


## Cluster Events

Events are emitted to interested parties.

* workerStart (pid, reason) - Upon exit of any worker process, the process id of the exited worker. Reasons include: "start", "restart", "failure", and "upgrade".
* workerExit (pid, reason) - Upon start of any worker process. Reasons include: "start", "restart", "failure", and "upgrade".


## Commands & Events

Creating custom, or overriding commands and events is as simple as:

	var cservice = require("cluster-service");
	cservice.on("custom", function(evt, cb, arg1, arg2) { // "custom" command
		// can also fire custom events
		cservice.trigger("on.custom.complete", 1, 2, 3);
	};
	
	cservice.on("test", function(evt, cb, testScript, timeout) { // we're overriding the "test" command
		// arguments
		// do something, no callback required (events may optionally be triggered)
	}; 
	
	// can also issue commands programatically
	cservice.trigger("custom", function(err) { /* my callback */ }, "arg1value", "arg2value");


## Unit Tests

Unit tests can be run using [nodeunit](https://github.com/caolan/nodeunit). You can run this shell command from the root of the project:

	npm test
	

## Code Coverage

Run:

	npm run-script coverage

Now you can view coverage using any browser here:
